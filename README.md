### About Me:

I'm a software developer with a foundation in computer science.

- 🚀 My journey began in high school when I discovered my love for programming and learned the C language.
- 🤓 While pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Moscow, Russia, I dived into web development, even freelancing on the side.
- 👨‍💻 After graduation, I worked as a full stack web developer at a Californian startup, wearing many hats and mastering React, Express.js, SQL, and more.
- 🌍 Remote work allowed me to travel Europe and Asia.
- 🎯 I thrive on challenges, which led to my relocation to the U.S. in 2023.
- 🌱 Besides coding, I enjoy skateboarding, traveling, and having meditative tea ceremonies.
